# London Audio & Music AI Meetup

## About

The purpose of this meetup is to provide a forum for the vibrant London community of AI/ML industry practitioners, scientists, engineers, academics, and students with a particular interest in audio and music applications to meet, socialise and learn from each other.

Topics of interest cover all facets of advanced technology applied to audio and music, such as (but not limited to): Music Information Retrieval (MIR), digital signal processing, speech processing, machine learning, acoustics, recommendation systems, music technology, software engineering, cognitive science, etc.

We like to keep it fun, friendly and free, so come and join other like-minded folks.
