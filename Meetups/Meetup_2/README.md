## Abstract
We study the user experience on Spotify through the lens of
diversityâ€”the coherence of the set of songs a user listens to. We
quantify how musically diverse every user is by taking advantage of a
high-fidelity song embedding. We find that high consumption diversity
is strongly associated with important long-term user metrics, such as
conversion and retention. However, we also find that
algorithmically-driven listening through recommendations is associated
with reduced consumption diversity. Furthermore, we observe that when
users become more diverse in their listening over time, they do so by
shifting away from algorithmic consumption and increasing their
organic consumption. Our work illuminates a central tension in online
platforms: how do we recommend content that users are likely to enjoy
in the short term while simultaneously ensuring they can remain
diverse in their consumption in the long term?
