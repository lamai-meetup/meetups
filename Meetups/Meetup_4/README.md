## Abstract
We introduce DeepAFx, a deep learning architecture in which an encoder analyzes input audio and learns to control audio effects (Fx) that themselves perform the desired signal manipulation. To combine deep learning and audio plugins together, we have developed a new method that incorporates third-party audio plugins as layers within deep neural networks. To train our network with non-differentiable Fx layers, we compute Fx layer gradients via a fast, parallel stochastic approximation scheme within a standard automatic differentiation graph. We demonstrate our approach with three audio production applications: tube amplifier emulation, automatic removal of breaths and pops from voice recordings, and automatic music mastering. We validate our results with a subjective listening test, showing our approach not only can enable new automatic audio effects tasks, but can yield results comparable to a state-of-the-art commercial solution for music mastering. Also, by using familiar and existing tools for audio processing and suggesting control parameters, we can create a unique paradigm that blends the power of AI with human creative control to empower creators.
