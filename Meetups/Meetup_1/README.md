## Abstract
A number of recent advances in audio synthesis rely on neural upsamplers, which can introduce undesired artifacts. In computer vision, upsampling artifacts have been studied and are known as checkerboard artifacts (due to their characteristic visual pattern). However, their effect has been overlooked so far in audio processing. Given their importance, together with the fact that the audio literature only provides sparse and unorganized insights, our recent work is aimed at advancing and consolidating our current understanding of neural upsamplers for audio synthesis.
